### setting up

- `npm install`
- [protoc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) `sudo apt install protobuf-compiler`

to generate protobuf files, run `make protobuf` in the root directory.

to run the server (both golang and vite) you must have a certificate and key in the form of `server/host-crt.pem` and `server/host-key.prm`

to generate such files, you should look into self signing with `openssl` or `xca`
